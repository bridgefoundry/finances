# Workshop Grant Applications

If you are not a established chapter with [funds at hand](../funding/status.md) or else have not found a sponsor to cover workshop expenses, Bridge Foundry is committed to supporting you in putting on your workshop, so you may [apply for a grant](https://docs.google.com/a/ultrasaurus.com/forms/d/1npx6D7iFl6yx6kBVlYTOG1-PiWMsDiTx_TQWNri1WIk/viewform). **As soon as you THINK you MAY need funds, please apply!** Since some parts of the funding process can take at least a week, it's better to start working on funding earlier in your event planning than in the last few weeks.

## Who May Request a Grant
* Any organizer who wants to hold a Bridge workshop that is in line with Bridge Foundry mission.  
* The organizer must be either a known and experienced organizer, or must be approved by a known chapter leader or experienced volunteer organizer.

## Standard criteria
* budget is within normal parameters for the region
* expenses are for normal recommended workshop things; see list of [allowed expenses](allowed-expenses.md)

## Approval process
Grant applications are evaluated within a calendar week of submission. If funds are available, first-time grant applications for Bridge workshops that meet standard criteria by an approved organizer are dispensed without further evaluation.

The following process guides our evaluation if there are more applications in a given week than we have available funds: If grant applications exceed current funding, the Bridge Foundry program director will assess impact and make a decision or raise additional funds to cover all applications.

## Post-Event

When you do receive funding from Bridge Foundry, we ask that you simply write a short blog post after your event on the [Bridge Foundry blog](http://bridgefoundry.org/blog.html) about how the grant helped you and your community hold the workshop and the difference it has made.

Sharing your experience inspires and helps other organizers understand what it takes to hold a workshop. You can submit a blog post as a [pull request](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/bridgefoundry.github.io/tree/master/_posts) or email to the [Bridge Foundry group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bridgefoundry).
