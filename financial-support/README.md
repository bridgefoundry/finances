## Tax-deductible receipts
When money is given/spent to further the mission of any of the Bridges, we are able to provide tax-deductible receipts for those donations.

### How it works

#### Request approval for a grant.
Bridge Foundry is committed to providing financial support for people who want to organize a workshop but haven't been able to raise funds for workshop expenses, whether it is a newcomer or a established chapter.

#### Request an invoice.

#### Submit receipts.

##### Pre-event

Ensure your expenses follow the current allowed expenses guidelines. For example:

**Upon Approval**: Plan your workshop and pay people! Be sure to keep all receipts and invoices related to event expenses.  

##### Post-Event

Whether you paid out of pocket and would like to request reimbursement, or someone paid for your expenses directly, you MUST submit receipts to finance@bridgefoundry.org. It is important for us to have these not only for our records, but to maintain our status as a 501(c)(3). Failure to do so may result in the denial of future grant requests.

## Operational cost coverage
Bridge Foundry is committed to ensuring that 100% of funds received from a sponsor will be available to the Bridge that raised it. We use funds received from our general sponsorship to cover the 12.5% overhead charged for us to operate as a program of the School Factory.
