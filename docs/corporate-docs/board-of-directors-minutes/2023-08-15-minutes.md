This meeting of the Bridge Foundry Board of Directors was held on Tuesday, August 15, 02:00 p.m. PT, having a quorum with everyone participating through an online video conference with live audio and screen-sharing.

Kinsey informed the board that she is planning parental leave.

Sarah motioned that Desi be named as Secretary, and furthermore that the board approve a leave of absence for Kinsey. During this leave of absence, Kinsey will not have voting status. She will notify the rest of the board members once she is ready to return from her leave. At that time, Kinsey will automatically be reinstated.

Sarah volunteered to serve as Governance Committee Chair.  Desi volunteered to serve as Communications Committee Chair. For each prior committee commitment, Kinsey will be noted as a member on leave and would resume active membership status upon her return.

This motion was duly seconded and passed unanimously by the board.

The board reviewed and accepted the August 15, 2023 minutes.

Respectfully submitted,

Kinsey Durham Grace
