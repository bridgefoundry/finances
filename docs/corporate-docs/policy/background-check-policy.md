**Background Check Policy**
**June 1, 2018**

Bridge Foundry runs a criminal background check for all employees, contractors, and volunteers who will be making payments out of Bridge Foundry accounts. 

Candidates for these roles may be disqualified on the basis of any criminal history related to fraud or financial misconduct. Other types of criminal history may also be a basis for disqualification if they relate to the candidate’s ability to perform their role appropriately. Candidates should not be disqualified for unrelated history.

Our current background check vendor is AccurateNow, and we use the “Standard” check that includes the following:

* SSN Trace & Address History
* 7- Year Criminal History*
* National Criminal Database
* National Sex Offender Registry
* Global Watch
