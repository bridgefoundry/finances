# GIFT ACCEPTANCE POLICY

Adopted 8/7/2017

**I.      	GENERAL GUIDELINES**

Bridge Foundry, Inc. (the "Corporation") welcomes commitments and gifts of financial support from any interested person or organization.  The Corporation's staff is pleased to meet with prospective donors and their advisors to explore their interests, the needs of the Corporation, the various gift options and the related tax consequences.  The Corporation will advise all donors to seek their own tax and legal counsel and will in no event render tax, legal or financial advice.

As a general rule, current gifts are encouraged in favor of deferred gifts.  Similarly, the Corporation encourages unrestricted gifts, but recognizes the importance of restrictions to some donors in ensuring that their particular interests are supported or funded.  Restricted gifts are therefore welcome, but only at specified funding levels and with the express understanding that the Corporation may use the funds as it deems appropriate if the donor's particular interest is no longer viable.

_Note:  The Corporation does not offer donor advised funds.  Donor restrictions, if any, must be made at the time the gift is made and must be limited to a particular use or activity conducted by the Corporation._

**II.    	CURRENT GIFT OPTIONS**

**A.    	Cash**



1.  Any amount is encouraged and welcome.
1.  While unrestricted contributions are encouraged, any donor has the option to restrict some or all of his or her gift to a specific program or use when the gift exceeds $50,000.00.
1.  The donor will be credited with the full amount of his or her cash gift unless otherwise desired.

**B.    	Gifts of intellectual property**



1.  Donations of code, curriculum, and other documentation appropriate to our programs and activities are accepted as part of our programmatic activities.
1.  By making these donations, donors agree that these materials may be shared publicly under an open source license.

We do not at this time accept donations of securities, stocks, insurance policies, real estate, or retirement benefits. The Board of Directors may vote to put into place a revised version of this policy at any time.
