# Corporate Cards

Chapters, Bridges, and other programs that operate under Bridge Foundry can sign
up to take advantage of our corporate cards program, which is managed through
[Divvy]. These cards act like debit cards and are tied to the programs as
specified in the application. They are designed to add greater flexibility and
accessibility to funds for our program leaders.

## Application Process

If you're a program leader and have not signed a [Volunteer Agreement] yet, please
reach out to operations@bridgefoundry.org and we'll get you set up.

When you're ready to receive a card, complete the [Card Application &
Agreement][card application] form and allow up to a week for the Finance team to
process this.

## Card Types

### Virtual Cards

After you've set up your Divvy account, you will automatically have the ability
to create virtual cards. You can have as many of these as you'd like for your
assigned budget(s) on Divvy. 

You can find out more about the different types of virtual cards and how to
manage them in [this article][virtual cards overview].

### Physical Cards

If you anticipate needing a physical card to make purchases, you may opt in to
receive one when you fill out the application. If you opted out initially and
change your mind later, you can order one through Divvy directly.

It takes **7-14 business days** after processing the application to receive your
card. You can also choose to pay $45 to expedite the the shipping to 4-6
business days. This fee will be deducted from the Chapter or Bridge fund you're
operating under.

#### Activation

Once you receive your physical card, you can activate it on the Divvy website or
mobile app. See this [Divvy help page][card activation] for instructions.

## Use Guidelines

- **Monitor your Divvy budget:** You can check your card and budget balances by
logging into [Divvy](https://app.divvy.co/). The budgets on Divvy are set based 
on an estimate of how much you'll be spending on a monthly basis. This amount
will never be higher than your total available funds. If you need to increase
your budget, please use the ["Request Funds" feature][request funds] on Divvy or
reach out to finance@bridgefoundry.org.

- **Monitor your overall funds:** The balance on our [master accounting
spreadsheet] reflects total available funds, including what is on your card. It
does not indicate how much is on the card. 

- **Save all receipts:** All charges made on your card(s) must be reconciled on
Divvy before the end of the month of when the expense incurred. Transaction
details must also include a copy of the receipt. Failure to complete transaction
details on time or  any misuse of funds may result in the revocation of card
privileges.
