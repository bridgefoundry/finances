# Internal Processes

This section is for documentation of Bridge Foundry's internal operations processes and procedures. We share it in the spirit of transparency, so feel free to look around if you want to take a peek under the hood. And, if you just want to know how to make things happen for your Bridge, Chapte, or Community, focus on the other sections of the guide.

There's not a lot here yet, but we plan to build it out in time.
