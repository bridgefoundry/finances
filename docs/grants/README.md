# About Grants
Bridge Foundry is committed to providing financial support to anyone who wants to organize a workshop. Independent Communities are able to take advantage of this support by applying for a grant.

## Funded Grants
In most cases, a [Volunteer Fundraiser](../roles/volunteer-fundraiser-policies.md) from your area solicits donations from local sponsors and then you can apply for a grant to receive those funds. We call these [Funded Grants](funded-grants.md).

## Seed Fund Grants
In cases where you are unsuccessful in raising funds to support your workshop, you can still apply for a grant! We call these [Seed Fund Grants](seed-grants.md) and they have their own approval process.

## Application
In both cases, the process starts by filling out a [Grant Application](https://forms.gle/ikoVftWbnaTrncCt6).
