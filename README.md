# Bridge Foundry

Bridge Foundry is transioning from a fiscally-sponsored program of program of the [School Factory](http://schoolfactory.org), which is a 501c3 organization (giving us non-profit status in the USA), supporting volunteers through Oct 30, 2017. (see [school-factory sub-folder](school-factory) for any current program needs).

Our goal is to start supporting volunteers in October via Bridge Foundry, Inc. a new 501c3 organization in the US.
