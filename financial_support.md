# Financial support
## Tax-deductible receipts
When money is given/spent to further the mission of any of the Bridges, we are able to provide tax-deductible receipts for those donations.

### How it works
[wip section]

Request approval for a grant.

Request an invoice.

Submit receipts.

## Operational cost coverage
Bridge Foundry is committed to ensuring that 100% of funds received from a sponsor will be available to the Bridge that raised it. We use funds received from our general sponsorship to cover the 12.5% overhead charged for us to operate as a program of the School Factory.
