# Workshop Grant Applications

If you do not have enough funds to cover workshop expenses, Bridge Foundry is committed to supporting you in putting on your workshop, so you may [apply for a grant](https://docs.google.com/a/ultrasaurus.com/forms/d/1npx6D7iFl6yx6kBVlYTOG1-PiWMsDiTx_TQWNri1WIk/viewform). **As soon as you THINK you MAY need funds, please apply!** Since some parts of the funding process can take at least a week, it's better to start working on funding earlier in your event planning than in the last few weeks.

When you do receive funding from Bridge Foundry, we ask that you simply write a short blog post after your event on the [Bridge Foundry blog](http://bridgefoundry.org/blog.html) about how the grant helped you and your community hold the workshop and the difference it has made. See below for details.

## Who May Request a Grant

* Any organizer who wants to hold a Bridge workshop that is in line with Bridge Foundry mission.  
* The organizer must be either a known and experienced organizer, or must be approved by a known chapter leader or experienced volunteer organizer.

Grant applications are evaluated within a calendar week of submission.  If funds are available, first-time grant applications for Bridge workshops that meet standard criteria are dispensed without further evaluation.  The following process guides our evaluation if there are more applications in a given week than we have available funds.

## Standard criteria

* budget is within normal parameters for the region
* expenses are for normal recommended workshop things
* person is an authorized spender (nominated by chapter or Bridge or somehow we believe they are credible)

If grant applications exceed current funding, Bridge Foundry program director will assess impact and make a decision or raise additional funds to cover all applications.

## Pre-event

Ensure your expenses follow the current allowed expenses guidelines. For example:

* Installfest refreshments/pizza
* Breakfast/lunch
* Babysitting
* After-party (also could be volunteer drink tickets)
* USB drives
* Nametags, pens, stickers and misc supplies

**Upon Approval**: Plan your workshop and pay people! Be sure to keep all receipts and invoices related to event expenses.  

## Post-Event

Whether you paid out of pocket and would like to request reimbursement, or someone paid for your expenses directly, you MUST submit receipts to finance@bridgefoundry.org. It is important for us to have these not only for our records, but to maintain our status as a 501(c)(3). Failure to do so may result in the denial of future grant requests.

Please write a blog post about your experience holding a workshop! Sharing your experience inspires and helps other organizers understand what it takes to hold a workshop. You can submit a blog post as a pull request or email to the [Bridge Foundry group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bridgefoundry).
