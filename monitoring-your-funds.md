# Monitoring Your Funds

In the [Master Accounting Bridge Foundry Financials](http://bit.ly/bridges-financials) we track financial information for Bridge Foundry and all of its sub-organizations. This is where you find all of the latest information about money that comes in and money that goes out.  In general, this should be current for anything that is more than 2 weeks ago (see the process timing tab for more detail on when updates happen).

In this spreadsheet, some of the tabs you will find are:

* *Org overview*: A running tally of money in/money/out and balance, as well as contact info, for each Bridge entity.
* *Audits*: Audit information, how it happens, and dates of audits performed.
* *Invoice status*: Status of each invoice submitted by sponsors.
* *Process timing*: Timing and schedules for processing all types of financial transactions and when this document is updated, which differs depending on the transaction.
* *Bridge & chapter funds*: Tabs with a running tally for each Bridge and each established chapter.

### Quarterly Chapter Spreadsheet Audit
During the first week of each quarter, the designated finance liaison from each chapter reviews their tab on the Master Financial Spreadsheet for Accuracy.
