# Bridge Foundry Financial Policies

School Factory is a non-profit organization whose mission is to support communities and spaces that transform education, and that is exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code (IRC). As a program of School Factory, Bridge Foundry and its sub-organizations must only spend money in support of its mission within IRS guidelines.

## Definitions
* Bridge Foundry (“Foundry”) is the support team for all the Bridges and their Chapters and free-form volunteer efforts.  The Foundry is led by a Program Director and representative board.
* Bridge, in this document, refers to a self-governing Bridge with its own board.  Each bridge focuses on a specific technology, or set of technologies, and shares open source curriculum and program materials across geographies.
* Chapter is a regional, technology-specific group that has repeat events.  Each Chapter belongs to a Bridge.

## Policies
It is our policy that the group (Foundry, Bridge or Chapter) that raises funds, gets to direct how the funds are spent; however, donations must be provided without restriction to Bridge Foundry, so as to streamline our internal processes (more on that below). We often communicate our intentions to sponsors and report on our progress, but it is important that those reports are not a formal commitment to allocate an exact amount of money to a specific program.  This allows allows the leadership of the Foundry, Bridge or Chapter the flexibility to reallocate funds as needed.

When volunteers or staff raise funds, they will associate the donation(s) with a specific Workshop, Chapter, Bridge, or Bridge Foundry.  All funds will be spent on educational and charitable activities to increase diversity in tech, so that the makers of technology accurately reflect the diversity of the users of technology and everyone can feel welcome and comfortable in our industry. All [allowed expenses](../using-funds/allowed-expenses.md) must be approved by a Workshop or Chapter leader, a Bridge board member, or a designated volunteer or staff person.

Any Bridge or Chapter will utilize funds only for charitable and educational activities consistent with our tax-exempt status described above. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Bridge will not intervene in any election or support or oppose any political party or candidate for public office, or engage in any lobbying not permitted by section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, or, if applicable, IRC 501§§(h) and 4911. Bridges or Chapters will not endorse political candidates or parties.
