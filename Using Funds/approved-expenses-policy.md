* Food
  * Breakfast and/or lunch
  * Installfest refreshments/food
* Playcare (childcare provided on site in the same building as the parents)

* Branded giveaways like t-shirts and stickers

## Bridges
* Software that supports Bridge operations (check with us first to see if we already have a discount or group account)
* Marketing for the Bridge

## Exceptions
If you will have different kinds of expenses because you are doing something new or different, contact us at finance@bridgefoundry.org. We aim to be as flexible as possible to support different approaches, and we just need to determine operational implications before approving new expense types. By signing the Volunteer Agreement, volunteers to wait to hear back about whether we can support a new type of expense before moving forward with any purchases.

All expenses that are exceptions or additions to this policy must be only for charitable and educational activities consistent with our tax-exempt status.
