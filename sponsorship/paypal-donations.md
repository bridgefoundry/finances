# Paypal Donations

We are able to create customized Paypal donation buttons that automatically earmark incoming donations for your chapter that you can place on your website. This makes it easier for sponsors or visitors to send small donations via your website -- which is great for garnering local support as you can easily direct small donors to your website without them worrying about mailing a check.

## How it works
- Fill in the [BridgeFoundry Paypal Button Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-KJP3EQeTZWbJX7NLZGF8nOAiCj04UHaPhRlrmCgexk/viewform) form.
- The code will be emailed to you and you can simply plug it into your site.
- Paypal donations are processed by accounting on the first and third Friday of each month. Once a donation is made via PayPal, it may take up to a few weeks to appear in your account. When they are transferred, they will be posted on the [Master Accounting Spreadsheet](../monitoring-your-funds.md).

## Some Key Points
- The donor can be directed to a page back on your site and that can be the home page or a thank you page. We're recommending the latter.
- This does not replace the Invoice request process for larger corporate sponsors who would like a tax-deductible receipt.
- Paypal takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, so we still recommend larger donors [mail a check](submit-payment.md) or you [request an invoice](request-invoice.md) as explained on the [sponsorship](../sponsorship/) page.
