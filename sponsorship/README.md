# Sponsorship
Bridge Foundry is able to accept **tax-deductible donations** on behalf of Bridges, workshops, and event organizers, and make those funds available for use by the Bridge members and organizers.

## How it works
- Typically, a sponsor asks for an invoice OR says that they will send a check (we'll invoice them just to streamline our process and be able to track who is actually doing what.)
- A Bridge member or workshop organizer [submits an invoice](request-invoice.md) for the sponsor.
- Upon receiving the Bridge Foundry invoice, the sponsor [submits the payment](submit-payment.md) to Bridge Foundry.
- Bridge Foundry's bookkeeper adds the amount to the [Bridge or chapter fund](../funding/status.md).
- For information about how a Bridge member or organizer can withdraw funds, please see our instructions for [using funds](../using-funds).
- School Factory will send a thank you letter with tax deduction info to sponsor when payment is received.

## Please note
Please see the instructions on how to [request a paypal button](paypal-donations.md) for your website for small donations.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide tax documentation for cash donations (including checks or gift cards given) directly to an individual. They need to come in to the 501(c)(3) via check, ACH, or paypal. Otherwise, the money isn't actually running through our 501(c)(3) and it's therefore not tax-deductible.

In-kind donations of actual items can be logged in a form at [http://schoolfactory.org/donate](http://schoolfactory.org/donate). Submitting that form will trigger our finance person to send the sponsor an acknowledgement letter usable for tax purposes.
