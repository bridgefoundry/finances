# Verify 501c3 status

Bridge Foundry is certified by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3).

There are two documents that allow for verifying our status with the IRS:

- [The Determination Letter](../documents/501c3_determination_letter.jpg) from the Internal Revenue Service -- a letter of certification by the Internal Revenue Service of School Factory's nonprofit status as a 501(c)(3).

- [The Memorandum of Agreement](../documents/bridgefoundry_supportmoa.pdf), which is the documentation of the fiscal sponsorship of Bridge Foundry by School Factory under their 501(c)(3).

It is rare that you will need either of these, but should the situation arise, please feel free to use them. Any questions should be directed to finance@schoolfactory.org.
