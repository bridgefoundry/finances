If you want to accept electronic donations online, we provide a number of options for that through Flipcause. You can:
- Embed a form directly on your website
- Embed a button on your website that pops open the form
- Request a hosted donations page if you don’t have your own website

For any of these options, complete the Flipcause Integration Request Form and we will send you the code to embed in your website and/or the link for the hosted page.

Flipcause charges a fee of 4.9% + 30 cents per transaction, which they allow the donor to pay. Most donors choose to pay the fee, but if they decline to do so the amount of money you receive will be lessened by that amount. For this reason, we encourage you to use the invoice process for large sponsors and ask them to pay via check or ACH. 

Online payments using Flipcause integration are great for smaller individual donations, especially if a donor is interested in setting up a recurring payment.

We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request. Feel free to email finance@bridgefoundry.org if you don’t hear back or have questions.
