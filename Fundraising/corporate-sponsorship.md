# Corporate Sponsorship
Most Chapters and Communities raise funds for their activities via corporate sponsorships. Once you have a [Volunteer Fundraiser](https://rebrand.ly/volunteer-fundraiser-policies) signed up for your group, they can reach out to companies in your area who might be interested in supporting your activities.

## Requesting an Invoice
In order to receive payment from a sponsor, please complete the [Bridge Foundry Invoice Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gu6WG2Nifj_579VhML_KZWpvi0bM0YpqsgZptSmU6Lw/viewform). An electronic invoice will be sent to the recipient's email address you specified in the request form within a week at the most (usually within a couple of business days). You will know when it goes out, because we cc you on the email as well. If you don't see the invoice go out within a few days, feel free to follow up with us at finance@bridgefoundry.org. Please complete one form for each sponsor/payment.

## Payment Methods
The sponsor may pay by any of the following methods once they receive the invoice:
* Check (default option; no fee)
* ACH (integrated into invoice if requested; flat 50¢ fee)
* Credit card (integrated into invoice if requested; 3.40% + 25¢ fee)
* PayPal (not preferred but an option if they ask; your group absorbs 2.2% + 30¢ fee)

When you fill out the Invoice Request Form, you can select which payment options you want activated on the invoice. In order to maximize your donation, we recommend either leaving the credit option off or asking them if they will consider covering the fees. Many sponsors prefer the convenience of credit card transactions and are happy to pay a few dollars more to cover the transaction fee, in which case we can include that as an additional line item on the invoice.
