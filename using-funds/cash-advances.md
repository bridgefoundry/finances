# Cash Advances

After being approved for a [grant](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/tree/master/grants), Independent Communities that can't afford to get reimbursed after the fact can receive funds via a cash advance.

If you receive more money than you spend, you will need to send back the extra funds. If you spend more than you received and there is money available, we will reimburse the remaining amount when you submit your receipts in Expensify. This extra reimbursement requires you to add your bank account in Expensify but otherwise doesn't add any more work for you.

If you opt to receive a cash advance, you must **submit all receipts from the workshop within 7 days of the workshop and must follow all of our [receipt policies](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/operations/blob/master/using-funds/README.md) exactly**, especially including itemization and proof of payment for each expense. Failure to do so or to return unused funds will prevent you from being able to receive another cash advance for future workshops.

If you select the cash advance option on the grant application, we will reach out to you about how to send you the money. We are currently investigating the best options for sending cash advances, but at this time we anticipate check and PayPal being the two primary options.
