# Using funds

Be sure to keep all receipts and invoices related to event expenses and make sure you only incur [allowed expenses](workshop-expenses.md).

## General guidelines
### Bridges and chapters with current funding
If you have collected donations and have enough to cover workshop expenses, AND you are either a Bridge or chapter leader OR have approval from one of them, you may spend your funds as you and your Bridge or chapter leader deem appropriate. In this case, **you do not need pre-approval from Bridge Foundry** to spend money on workshops.

### Bridges and chapters without current funding
Bridge Foundry is committed to supporting you in putting on your workshop, so you should [apply for a grant](../financial-support/workshop-grant-applications.md) as soon as you think you might need funds.

## Accessing funds
Whether funds for a workshop were obtained via a sponsorship or through a Bridge Foundry grant, there are multiple ways to get access to your fund.

### Pex Card
You can use a [Pex Card](pex-cards.md) if you have or are eligible for one. Restrictions apply.

### Working with vendors
You can have vendors invoice Bridge Foundry directly. In fact, it is preferred.

See further instructions about [working with vendors](working-with-vendors.md) for information on how to have Bridge Foundry pay vendors directly and how to engage a vendor as a preferred vendor.

### Reimbursement
You can request reimbursement for any and all expenses related to a workshop, including small items that volunteers pick up (e.g. name tags, muffins,) by submitting an [expense report](expense-report.md).

## Submitting receipts

Whether funds for a workshop were obtained via a sponsorship or through a Bridge Foundry grant, or if the funds have already been disbursed or you need a reimbursement, receipts must be submitted within 7 days of the workshop.

**Note: receipts need not be submitted if a sponsor pays for something directly.** We track receipts for all money that is donated to Bridge Foundry and then spent for our programs.

There are two ways to submit receipts:
- submit an [expense report](expense-report.md)
- send receipts via email to finance@bridgefoundry.org. Include the date of the workshop in your email.

The receipts are not only for our collective records, but are required for tax purposes, ensuring that we can maintain our 501(c)(3) status.
