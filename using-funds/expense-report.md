Get Set Up On Expensify:

Complete and submit this form: http://goo.gl/forms/7PjAqgoGM2.
Once you have received an email from Expensify notifying you that you have been added to the “Bridge Foundry Policy”, create an account on Expensify and submit your report. You should be set up within one business day. If you do not receive an Expensify confirmation that you have been added to the “Bridge Foundry Policy” within that time frame, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org.
​You can sign in with an existing account like Google or set up a username and password
Add your bank account (do this before submitting your report to get paid faster!). The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement -- or who you would like the reimbursement to go to. Your chapter does not need a bank account to do this, but any organizer who wants to be reimbursed does. For your protection, we recommend that individuals sign up for their own account and enter their own bank information.
Click on the icon in the upper right corner of the screen and select “Personal Settings”
On the right side of the screen, select “Reimbursement”, then add a deposit account. You will need your routing and account numbers.
Once the account is added, Expensify will make three deposits into your account that you will need to verify in order to receive reimbursement via the account.
Report Submission Requirements:

When submitting reports, the following must be included to receive reimbursement:

For workshop expenses, include the date(s) of the workshop in the report name.
Select an expense category and a tag (your chapter name or general fund) for each individual expense. List specifics in the Comment field for expenses in the Other category.
All expenses must have receipts attached.
Expenses must be for a chapter or fund you are approved to submit expenses for, and fall into approved expense categories.
You must have a bank account set up in the system.
To submit expenses for reimbursement:

Create a new report and add all expenses to be reimbursed, following all the guidelines under “requirements” above. See examples in screen shot below:



Submit the report using the button near the top left of the screen.
If you haven’t already, add a bank account so you can receive payment.
You will receive an email when the expense report has been approved. Feel free to email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org if you aren’t seeing approval come through within a week of submission.
If you haven’t added a bank account yet when the report is approved, Expensify will send you an email asking you to add an account. You won’t get paid until you have added an account.
PLEASE NOTE that if you DO NOT select the "Bridge Foundry" policy in the upper right hand corner of the report, it won't be submitted to us and we will not recevie notification that you've submitted a report.
ACH payments will be processed on Wednesdays and will arrive in your bank account about 2 business days later. To prevent delay of your reimbursement, please ensure your bank account information is included on your login.


International Payments:

If you are located outside of the United States: follow the same instructions for submitting a report, but make sure to select the correct currency for each expense. The system will automatically convert it to US dollars. You won’t be able to add a bank account for ACH reimbursement though, so email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org to let us know you need the payment via PayPal. Let us know the email address your PayPal account is set up through. If you don’t have an account, you will need to set one up to receive reimbursements.
